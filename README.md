# Pandas-Challenge
 
Within this module, I met with multiple classmates to brainstorm ideas and work on the homework together. I also met with ASKBCS tutors who instructed me that the error code showing on my code currently isn't to worry about and that it occurs since there are different versions of Python. I also was able to debug my code using help from online resources like Google.
